# microservice-example

## Project for showing how to use autodownloaded models in your future microservices.

How to use it?

- specify orm models (only names are required), names will be used to request orm structure
- modify load_models to your needs
- create any sctipt that will query db
- import package where models declared
- import load_models

# Congratulations! Now you can use your models as usual with sqlalchemy, and manage them in just one place!
