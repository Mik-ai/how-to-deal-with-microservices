# service that allow to control orm models from one place.

How to use it?

- delcare models somewere
- create sqlalchemy column structures as if you wanted to use mapped_column(), but make it into dict
- specify them in routers
- and edit endpoints

# Congratulations! Now you can use your models as usual with sqlalchemy, and manage them in just one place!
